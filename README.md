## 🇲🇽 About Me
Hi! I am a recent graduate from the University of California, Irvine, driven by a fervor for harnessing cutting-edge technology to create innovative solutions. My educational journey has primarily centered on software development, with a particular focus on mobile and web application development.

My motivation for diving into the world of software engineering is twofold. Firstly, I am deeply committed to empowering underrepresented communities, inspired by my own background as a first-generation Mexican-American. I want to shatter the notion that technology is an unattainable dream and share knowledge and resources, especially with marginalized groups.

Secondly, I am an ardent builder. Whether it's through coding web applications, community outreach, or expressing creativity through various mediums, I relish the process of bringing ideas to life. This journey amalgamates my passions for technology, art, and community, and my goal is to employ my diverse experiences and technical skills to make a positive impact on the community.

I am excited to connect and explore opportunities for collaboration in pursuit of positive change. Let's connect and make a difference together!
